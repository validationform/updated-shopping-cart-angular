# updated-shopping-cart-angular
There's a shop page with 5 food items and it will have a cart page which will be the child of the shop page   The items will have a picture along with a (-) button (+) button and a counter When we click on (+), increment the value, when we click on (-) decrement the value  As we do either of the two operations, the cart also needs to be updated   When we go to the cart page, we should see the list of items with their respective count. On the cart page, The items will have a picture along with a (-) button (+) button and a counter  We can click on the buttons on the cart page as well and this will update the counter and should reflect on the shop page
